# Technical Interview Challenge: TikTok Data Pipeline

## Overview
In this challenge, you'll be working with a mock TikTok API service to build a data pipeline that processes video data for our analytics dashboard. The challenge involves working with background jobs, API integration, and data transformation.

## Requirements

### 1. Background Job Setup (Required)
- Set up Sidekiq in the Rails application
- Create a worker that fetches data from our MockTiktokService
- Configure the worker to run every 30 minutes

### 2. Data Transformation (Required)
The worker should transform the TikTok video data into the following format before saving:

```ruby
{
    video_id: String, # TikTok's video ID
    creator: {
        username: String, # Creator's username
        region: String # Creator's region code
    },
    performance: {
        views: Integer, # Total views
        likes: Integer, # Total likes
        engagement_rate: Float, # (likes + comments + shares) / views 100
        trending_score: Integer # Algorithm-based score (explained below)
    },
    content: {
        description: String, # Video description
        duration: Integer, # Video duration in seconds
        hashtags: Array<String>, # Array of hashtag names
        category: String # Video label category
    },
    timestamps: {
        created_at: DateTime, # TikTok creation timestamp
        ingested_at: DateTime # When our system processed it
    }
}
```


#### Trending Score Algorithm

The trending score is a number from 0-100 that combines three factors about a video's performance. Here's exactly how to calculate it:

1. **View Velocity (40% of final score)**
   - Calculate views per hour since the video was posted.
   - If views/hour is 1000 or higher, score is 100.
   - If views/hour is 0, score is 0.
   - Otherwise: `score = (views per hour / 1000) * 100`.

2. **Engagement Rate (35% of final score)**
   - Calculate total engagements: (likes + comments + shares).
   - Calculate engagement rate: `(total engagements / views) * 100`.
   - If engagement rate is 15% or higher, score is 100.
   - If engagement rate is 0%, score is 0.
   - Otherwise: `score = (engagement rate / 15) * 100`.

3. **Recency (25% of final score)**
   - If video is less than 6 hours old, score is 100.
   - If video is more than 72 hours old, score is 0.
   - Otherwise: `score = ((72 - hours_since_posted) / 72) * 100`.

The final trending score is calculated as:
`(view_velocity_score * 0.4) + (engagement_score * 0.35) + (recency_score * 0.25)`

Round the final score to the nearest integer and ensure it stays within the 0-100 range.

**Example:**
A video has 2000 views/hour (100 points), 10% engagement rate (67 points), and is 12 hours old (83 points).
Final score = `(100 * 0.4) + (67 * 0.35) + (83 * 0.25) = 84`

### 3. API Endpoints (Required)
